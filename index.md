# DBI Lab's Website

## Brief Description: 
DBI Lab is a translational research lab based at the National University of Singapore that integrates behavioral science, digital health, and artificial intelligence to improve cardiometabolic health and population well-being.The lab focuses on working in multidisciplinary teams to develop, evaluate, and implement theory-driven, data-enabled interventions that bridge the intention–behaviour gap in real-world healthcare and community settings.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Our research examines how people make health decisions in daily life and how digital technologies can support sustained behaviour change. Key areas include obesity and cardiometabolic disease prevention, self-regulation and motivation, digital phenotyping, just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), and the implementation of AI-enabled health solutions. We combine behavioral theory, clinical data, and advanced analytics to generate evidence that is both scientifically rigorous and clinically actionable.

DBI Lab leads and collaborates on interdisciplinary projects spanning digital weight management, cardiometabolic health, body image and weight stigma.
Our projects range from observational trials, randomized controlled trials, implementation studies to the co-design and evaluation of digital health tools deployed in healthcare systems and communities.
